# easy-bi
A simple and easy Business Intelligence (BI) tool

For now this is just a collection of BI-related packages / .hs files that I have been working on for various projects. I'm going to collect them in this repository and will try to combine them into a single well-formed library.

## Packages

### `easy-bi-vis`

Implementation of [_Automating the design of graphical presentations of relational information_](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/22949.22950) by Jock Mackinlay (ACM Transactions on Graphics 5, 2 (1986) 110-141). Defines a set of rules for assigning dimensions to channels to create sensible visualisations of relational data.
